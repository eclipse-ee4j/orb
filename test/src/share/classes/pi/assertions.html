passing it an ORBInitInfo object.</li>
</ul>
<u>ORBInitInfo:</u>
<ul>
<li>
Interceptors cannot be registered on an ORB after it has been returned

<hr WIDTH="100%">Test: pi.iorinterceptor</h2>
Tests IORInterceptor and IORInfo, as covered in orbos/99-12-02, Chapter
7.
<h3>
Assertions covered:</h3>
<u>IORInterceptor:</u>
<ul>
<li>
A server side ORB calls the establish_components operation on all registered
IORInterceptor instances when it is assembling the list of components that
will be included in the profile or profiles of an object reference.</li>

<u>IORInfo:</u>
<ul>
<li>
add_ior_component and add_ior_component_to_profile adds a tagged component
to the set which will be included when constructing IORs. add_ior_component
will cause a tagged component to be added to all profiles. add_ior_component_to_profile
causes a tagged component to be added to only the profile with the specified
id. <i>Note that, in our ORB this all reduces to the same thing since we
only ever have an IIOP profile.</i></li>

<li>
any number of components may exist with the same component ID.</li>

send_request (5.2.1.1.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
invoked before request is sent to server</li>

<li>
SYSTEM_EXCEPTION raised implies no other interceptors' send_request operations
are called.&nbsp; Those Interceptors on the Flow stack are popped and their
receive_exception interception points are called.</li>

<li>
ForwardRequest raised implies no other Interceptors' send_request operations
are called.&nbsp; Those interceptors on the flow stack are popped and their
receive_other interception points are called.</li>
</ul>

<li>
receive_reply (5.2.1.3.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
invoked after it is returned from the server and before control is returned
to the client.</li>

<li>
SYSTEM_EXCEPTION raised implies no other Interceptors' receive_reply operations
are called.&nbsp; The remaining interceptors in the flow stack shall have
their receive_exception interception point called.</li>
</ul>

<li>
receive_exception (5.2.1.4.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
invoked when an exception occurs.</li>

<li>
ForwardRequest implies no other interceptors' receive_exception operations
are called.&nbsp; The remaining Interceptors in the flow stack are popped
and have their receive_other interception point called.</li>
</ul>

<li>
receive_other (5.2.1.5.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
invoked when a request results in something other than a normal reply or
an exception.</li>

<li>
SYSTEM_EXCEPTION raised implies no other Interceptors' receive_other operations
are called.&nbsp; The remaining interceptrs in the flow stack are popped
and have their receive_exception interception point called.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The interceptor list is traversed in order on the sending interception
points and in reverse order on the receiving interception points. (5.2.2.)</li>

<li>
Client-side Flow Rules:</li>

<ul>
<li>
One and only one of send_request or send_poll is called on any given request/reply
sequence. (5.2.2.1.)</li>

<li>
One and only one of receive_reply, receive_exception, or receive_other

interception point called.</li>
</ul>

<li>

<li>
COMM_FAILURE or similar exception may result in a retry of the request.&nbsp;
While this retry is a new request with respect to interceptors, there is
one point of correlation between the original request and the retry:&nbsp;
because control has not returned to the client, the PortableInterceptor::Current
for both the original request and the retrying request is the same. (5.2.1.4.)
- Difficult to simulate these conditions in a test.</li>

<li>
Same as above for ForwardRequest (5.2.1.5.) - Will be tested once implemented.</li>

TRANSIENT with a minor code of TBD_T (5.2.2.2.). - Will be tested once
implemented.</li>

<li>
One a oneway call, receive_reply is called before control is returned to
the client (5.2.2.2.) - Spec requires clarification.</li>

If SYSTEM_EXCEPTION is raised in receive_exception, this has the effect
of changing the exception which successive interceptors popped from the

raised to the client will be the last exception raised by an Interceptor,
or the original exception if no Interceptor changes the exception (5.2.1.4.)</li>
