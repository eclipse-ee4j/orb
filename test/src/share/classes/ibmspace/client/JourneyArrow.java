// Arrow represents an arrow to be drawn between two points.  It
// also has some behavior specific to this game.  Namely, (1) you
// can shorten the head or tail so that the the end points can be
// the centers of planet gifs while the arrows are drawn between
// the planet perimeters, and (2) you can also shorten the tail to
// show progress of a journey (the tail shortens until the fleet
// reaches the destination planet.  Even with these, this is probably
// a generally useful class fo UI work.  The arrow head drawing code
// is not but it's fast.
