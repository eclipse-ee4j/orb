/**
 * This class is used for reporting locate forward exceptions and object forward GIOP messages back to the ORB. In this
 * case the ORB must remarshal the request before trying again. Stubs which use the stream-based model shall catch the
 * <code>RemarshalException</code> which is potentially thrown from the <code>_invoke()</code> method of
 * <code>ObjectImpl</code>. Upon catching the exception, the stub shall immediately remarshal the request by calling
 * <code>_request()</code>, marshalling the arguments (if any), and then calling <code>_invoke()</code>. The stub shall
 * repeat this process until <code>_invoke()</code> returns normally or raises some exception other than
 * <code>RemarshalException</code>.
