         <TITLE>Extending the CORBA test framework</TITLE> 
  </HEAD> 
  <BODY BACKGROUND="images/backgrounds/p12c08.gif">
         <H2>Introduction</H2>
         <P>The CORBA project's testing requirements have been met by a custom
                framework oringinally written by IBM. This was enhanced to include the
                capability to run tests that require multiple separate processes by the
                addition of the corba.framework.CORBATest class, originally written by Everett
                Anderson. I have enhanced the framework in some ways as well, in particular by
                making it easy to debug tests. In addition a number of more recent tests have
                been written using JUnit, which provides a very effective unit test
                framework.</P>
         <P>While this framework has worked well for some time, recent developments
                suggest the need for further evolution. In no particular order, here are some
                recent considerations:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>It would be useful to change the port numbers used in the tests so
                  that more than one developer can share a single fast server machine.</LI>
                <LI>We should be able to run tests against both the compiled class files
                  (for quick turnaround) and against the as-delivered jar files (for final
                  verification).</LI>
                <LI>A number of recent features are configurable in ways that have global
                  effects on all tests. This includes JSG, Dynamic RMI-IIOP, and nio select.</LI>
         </OL>
         <P>This suggests that we need to enhance both the description of our tests,
                and the description of the environment used to run the tests. The standard way
                to do this nowadays is XML, but I'll probably consider something scheme based
                instead, or perhaps Harold's lxml syntax.</P>
         <H2>Test Environment</H2>
         <P>There are a large number of parameters that are configured for
                tests:</P>
