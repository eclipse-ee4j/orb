         <H2>Dynamic RMI-IIOP</H2> 
         <P>One important new feature in the PEORB in app server 8.1 is the ability
                to use RMI-IIOP without any build-time code generation using a tool such as
                rmic. The traditional model for remote method invocation is to first compile a
                remote interface and its implementation, then use rmic to generate stubs and
                skeletons. This requires that rmic analyze a lot of information, either by
                using a Java compiler front end, or by using a library that enables the reading
                of class files. rmic must then write out a number of Java source files for
                stubs and ties to a file system, and then finally invoke the Java compiler to
                generate the class files for the stubs and ties, which are then loaded in the
                usual manner through a ClassLoader.</P> 
         <P>This adds up to a lot of overhead, since this process effectively
                requires reading and writing a lot of information through the file system. In
                fact, we found in the past that rmic was responsible for perhaps 50% of the
                total time needed to deploy an EJB. The idea behind dynamic RMI-IIOP is to
                generate code for stubs and ties as needed at runtime, completely avoiding the
                overhead of file system I/O. The major question is, how expensive is it to use
                dynamic RMI-IIOP instead of static stubs and ties?</P> 
         <H3>The PresentationManager</H3> 
         <P>Because Dynamic RMI-IIOP does not rely on generated code for stubs and
                ties, much of the class analysis that is done by rmic must instead be done in
                the ORB implementation. It turned out to be impossible to re-use any of the
                RMIC implementation for this purpose, so we created a new part of the ORB
                architecture to handle this. We call this the PresentationManager.</P> 
         <P>The PresentationManager provides the following interface:</P> 
         <PRE>
public interface PresentationManager {
    ClassData getClassData( Class cls ) ;

    DynamicMethodMarshalled getDynamicMethodMarshalled( Method method ) ;

    StubFactoryFactory getStubFactoryFactory( boolean isDynamic ) ;

    void setStubFactoryFactory( boolean isDynamic, StubFactoryFactory sff ) ;

    Tie getTie() ;

    boolean useDynamicStubs() ;
} ;</PRE> 
         <P>Here is a summary of the various methods on this interface:</P> 
         <UL> 
                <LI>The ClassData primarily provides access to the IDLNameTranslator,
                  which translates between the RMI-IIOP method name passed on the GIOP request
                  and the Java method represented by this name. The ClassData also provides the
                  repository IDs for the remote interface, and also an InvocationHandlerFactory
                  that is used in dynamic stubs.</LI> 
                <LI>The DynamicMethodMarshaller provides a uniform interface for reading
                  and writing arguments, results, and exceptions for a particular method.</LI> 
                <LI>The StubFactoryFactory is used whenever the ORB needs to obtain a
                  StubFactory which can create a Stub. For example, whenever an object reference
                  is unmarshalled, the ORB will attempt to get a Stub for the object
                  reference.</LI> 
                <LI>getTie returns a Dynamic Tie which can be used anywhere an RMI-IIOP
                  Tie is needed (typically in the POA).</LI> 
         </UL> 
         <P>The ClassData and DynamicMethodMarshallers are somewhat expensive to
                compute, so they are cached in the implementation of the
                PresentationManager.</P> 
         <H3>Ties</H3> 
         <P>First, let's look briefly at the problem of dynamic Ties. A tie class
                must extend org.omg.PortableServer.Servant (so that the tie can be used in a
                POA) and implent javax.rmi.CORBA.Tie, as required by the OMG RMI-IIOP
                specification (Ref XXX). The Tie interface is as follows:</P> 
         <PRE>
public interface Tie extends org.omg.CORBA.portable.InvokeHandler {
    org.omg.CORBA.Object thisObject() ;

    void deactuvate() throws java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException ;

    ORB orb() ;

    void orb( ORB orb ) ;

    void setTarget( java.rmi.Remote target ) ;

    java.rmi.Remote getTarget() ;
}

public interface InvokeHandler {
    OutputStream _invoke( String method, InputStream input,
        ResponseHandler handler ) ;
}</PRE> 
         <P>The key methods here are the setTarget and _invoke methods. The
                setTarget method is used to set the actual implementation of a remote object
                that is to be used in this Tie. The invoke method is used by the ORB to perform
                the actual invocation in the server of the remote operation named by the method
                String. This invocation is implemented as follows:</P> 
         <OL> 
                <LI>Obtain the actual Java method to be invoked from the method String
                  (this is actually rather complicated due to the complex name mangling rules
                  defined by the RMI-IIOP specification).</LI> 
                <LI>Unmarshal the arguments for this operation from the InputStream.</LI>
                
                <LI>Invoke the actual method on the target with the arguments.</LI> 
                <LI>Use the ResponseHandler to create an appropriate type of response for
                  the request as an OutputStream.</LI> 
                <LI>Write the results of the invocation to the OutputStream, which is the
                  result of the _invoke call.</LI> 
         </OL> 
         <P>In the static case, this is accomplished through generated code. Step 1
                is done with a case statement that effectively maps from the method name in the
                _invoke call to the Java method as found in the generated code. Specific
                arguments are unmarshalled, and then passed in a call to the _invoke method.
                The result is marshalled to the OutputStream using a method appropriate to the
                declared type of the result. This means that there is a specific Tie class for
                each type of remote object.</P> 
         <P>The dynamic case handles this somewhat differently. First, there is only
                one type of Tie in Dynamic RMI-IIOP, which is the
                com.sun.corba.ee.impl.presentation.rmi.ReflectiveTie class. This class can act
                as a Tie for any valid remote interface. An instance of the Tie class discovers
                what kind of Tie it is by reflectively analyzing the Class of the target in the
                setTarget call. The setTarget call uses the PresentationManager to obtain the
                ClassData. The _invoke method is then implementated as follows, following the
                steps above:</P> 
         <OL> 
                <LI>Use the IDLNameTranslator to get the Java Method from the method
                  passed into the _invoke() call.</LI> 
                <LI>Use the PresentationManager to get the DynamicMethodMarshalled from
                  the java method. Unmarshal the arguments using the
                  DynamicMethodMarshaller.</LI> 
                <LI>Invoke the method with the target and the unmarshalled arguments
                  using Java reflection.</LI> 
                <LI>Use the ResponseHandler to create the result OutputStream.</LI> 
                <LI>Use the DynamicMethodMarshaller to write the results to the result
                  OutputStream.</LI> 
         </OL> 
         <P>Obviously there is some concern here in the performance of Dynamic Ties.
                Every step here is slower than the corresponding step in the static case.
                However, this does not matter for one simple reason: Ties are only used in the
                case of a remote invocation. The cost of a remote invocation is dominated by
                two factors: the cost of the data transfer, and (perhaps primarily) the cost of
                marshalling the data. Compared to the two factors, the extra overhead of the
                ReflectiveTie is negligible.</P> 
         <P>It is worth noting that the relative costs of remote calls are subject
                to change as technology evolves. The transmission cost may diminish to near
                zero, as very high speed interfaces (like InfiniBand) with advanced RDMA based
                transport hardware. This leaves the cost of the marshalling, which is an
                interesting design and reseach challenge at this time. Certainly it might be
                necessary to re-visit the cost of the ReflectiveTie implementation if we found
                a way to substantially speed up the marshalling.</P> 
         <H3>Stubs</H3> 
         <P>Stubs present a rather more complex problem than the Ties. The ORB must
                create a stub in certain cases:</P> 
         <OL> 
                <LI>When a remote object is unmarshalled (in CDRInputStream_1_0)</LI>
                <LI>When a remote object is narrowed</LI>
                <LI>When PortableRemoteObject.toStub is called</LI> 
         </OL>
         <P>The creation of a stub is handled by the Utility.loadStub method. This
                must be able to handle both RMI-IIOP and IDL stubs. Originally, this was almost
                the same, as both cases were handled by calling Class.newInstance on the
                appropriate Stub class. However, only RMI-IIOP can support dynamic stubs: IDL
                requires compiler generated stubs. This is because the IDL stub requires
                parsing of the IDL language definition of the interface. This call to
                Class.newInstance is using the Class object as a factory for the stub.</P>
         <P>This architecture was workable when all stubs were static, but with
                dynamic stubs, there may not be a Class available to use as a factory. We also
                do not want to create a customer ClassLoader to support stubs, as this would
                make ORB integration with the app server more difficult. Consequently I
                re-wrote parts of the RMI-IIOP code in terms of a StubFactory. In the static
                case, the StubFactory simply calls Class.newInstance to create a stub. </P>
         <P>Stubs also have a greater impact on performance than the ties. The stub
                is always used on every call for both the remote and co-located cases. The
                performance of a trivial co-located call is on the order of 1-5 microseconds
                depending on options with static stubs. We do not want this case to become
                significantly slower in the dynamic stub case.</P>
         <P>I have written two different implementations of dynamic stubs: one that
                uses the standard JDK dynamic proxy mechanism, and another using stubs
                generated at runtime using the apache BCEL library. These approaches can be
                compared in a number of ways:</P>
         <DL>
                <DT>RMI-IIOP Specification Compliance.</DT>
                <DD>Unfortunately javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub is a class, not an interface. The
                  RMI-IIOP specification (ref XXX) also requires that all RMI-IIOP stubs extend
                  the Stub class. This means that dynamic proxies cannot be used to create a
                  fully compliant RMI-IIOP stub.</DD>
                <DT>Java standards compliance</DT>
                <DD>Dynamic proxies have been part of the JDK since 1.3 and are well
                  supported. The BCEL library is not a standard API.</DD>
                <DT>Simplicity</DT>
                <DD>It is easier in terms of the overall stub architecture to use BCEL
                  rather than dynamic proxies. This is due to the lack of problems relating to
                  the javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub base class when the BCEL approach is used.</DD>
                <DT>Performance</DT>
                <DD>The BCEL approach is actually faster than the dynamic proxy approach.
                  This is due to the ability to tune the code generation to the needs of stubs,
                  rather than requiring that a general framework be used.</DD>
         </DL>
         <H4>Stub Architecture</H4>
         <P>The following diagram illustrates the required stub
                architecture:</P><IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="796" HEIGHT="631" SRC="stubs.gif">
         <P>The blue classes are the classes defined in the OMG standards. They
                define the methods shared by all remote references. Orange represents those
                classes defined as part of Java. The yellow interface represents some remote
                interface for which we are examining the different sorts of stubs.</P>
         <P>Three sorts of stubs are illustrated here: standard static stubs, as
                defined in the RMI-IIOP specification (the purple class), stubs and supporting
                classes for the proxy implementation (in green), and the BCEL-based stubs
                (shown in red). Each of these cases is described in the following sections.</P>
         <P>The basic remote method invocation mechanism shares the same basic
                outline in all three cases:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>Determine the method name for the remote request.</LI>
                <LI>Obtain the delegate that represents the remote reference.</LI>
                <LI>Determine whether the request is local. If not local:
                  <OL>
                         <LI>Use the delegate to create a request which is represented as an
                                OutputStream.</LI>
                         <LI>Marshal the arguments to the OutputStream.</LI>
                         <LI>Tell the delegate to finish the invocation.</LI>
                         <LI>Unmarshal the result</LI>
                         <LI>Inform the delegate that the call has completed
                                (releaseReply)</LI>
                         <LI>Return the result</LI>
                  </OL></LI>
                <LI>Otherwise, this is a local call:
                  <OL>
                         <LI>Use the servant_preinvoke method on the delegate to obtain a
                                ServantObject.</LI>
                         <LI>Copy the arguments if necessary to preserve the correct RMI-IIOP
                                semantics.</LI>
                         <LI>Invoke the method on the servant obtained from the
                                ServantObject.</LI>
                         <LI>Copy the result if necessary.</LI>
                         <LI>Inform the delegate that the call has completed
                                (servant_postinvoke)</LI>
                         <LI>Return the result</LI>
                  </OL></LI>
         </OL>
         <P>This is the basic outline, ignoring various exception cases. Most
                exceptions are simply returned to the caller after being unmarshalled, much as
                an ordinary result, but the exceptions are thrown, instead of returned from the
                method. One particular exception has special meaning: the RemarshalException.
                If a RemarshalException is thrown, the stub code goes all the way back to the
                beginning to start the invocation process again. This is necessary in this
                model to support the LocationForward mechanism defined in the GIOP
                protocol.</P>
         <H4>Static Stubs</H4>
         <P>Classes with names like _XXX_Stub are generated by rmic. They extend the
                javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub class as required by the RMI-IIOP specification, and
                implement the remote interfaces. While these stubs could be generated in many
                ways, the stubs generated by rmic -iiop duplicate the complete method
                invocation logic in each method. </P>
         <P>The general invoke logic is all generated in place for each method. This
                is really the optimal way to generate the stubs, as each method can be
                customized for the exact types of arguments, result, and exceptions thrown by
                the method. However, it is not clear that this is really worthwhile, given the
                optimizing capabilities of modern VMs that can use agressive inlining at
                runtime.</P>
         <H4>Dynamic Stubs</H4>
         <P>The invocation logic for both kinds of dynamic stubs is the same, since
                both cases actually use the same InvocationHandler to handle the methods on the
                remote interface. This code (found in StubInvocationHandlerImpl) operates as
                follows:</P>
         <UL>
                <LI>The method name for the remote request is obtained from the
                  IDLNameTranslator in a reversal of the mechanism used in Ties.</LI>
                <LI>All marshalling, unmarshalling, and copying of arguments and results
                  is handled by a DynamicMethodMarshaller</LI>
                <LI>In the co-located case, the invocation is handled using
                  reflection.</LI>
         </UL>
         <P>The main differences between the two types of stubs are in how they are
                constructed, and how all of the non-remote interface methods are handled.</P>
         <P>The performance of the co-located invocation case is crucial for some
                applications of the app server. Probably the most important aspect of this cost
                is the overhead of copying arguments and results. This is highly optimized in
                the app server using a complex reflective copier, but even calling the copier
                for simple data types is expensive. This is not a problem in the static stub
                case, since the generated code only calls the copier for non-primitive types,
                but this is more difficult in the dynamic case. If we look at the arguments in
                the dynamic case, all arguments are objects of some type. Primitives are
                wrapper in the java.lang wrappers of the appropriate type. However, there is no
                way to tell inside the call whether an Integer is really an int (which cannot
                be aliased, and so need not be copied), or really an Integer (which must be
                copied in order to preserve aliasing). However, the DynamicMethodMarshaller is
                constructed with complete type information on the Method, so it can tell
                whether or not copying is required. Consequently the StubInvocationHandler
                delegates the decision about whether or not to invoke the current copier to the
                DynamicMethodMarshaller, which analyzed the Method argument types. If the
                arguments are all primitives, the DynamicMethodMarshaller copy method does
                nothing, otherwise it calls the copier.</P>
         <P>This optimization allows us to measure the actual overhead of the
                dynamic invocation, and make a fair comparison in the performance test. The
                restuls are that the dynamic case is only about 50% slower than the static
                case. This is quite good, as the colocated case is already highly optimized,
                and the EJB layer adds sufficient overhead so that this 50% slowdown is not
                noticeable. JDK 5.0 will provide even better performance, firstly because it is
                already about 3 times faster on the same hardware, and also because the
                concurrency utilities should be far faster than the old concurrency library
                currently used by the ORB. This change should be significant because the POA
                synchonization overhead for enter and exit is quite high.</P>
         <P>The end result is that dynamic RMI-IIOP has sufficiently good
                performance that we no longer see a need for any use of rmic in the normal use
                of the app server. The only remaining case where stubs are needed is when an
                EJB is deployed which must be accessible to a client written using another ORB
                that does not support dynamic RMI-IIOP (in other words, any ORB other than the
                one we ship in the app server).</P>
         <H5>Dynamic Proxy Stubs</H5>
         <P>The dynamic proxy case is somewhat more complex due to the need to
                duplicate some of the methods defined in ObjectImpl and in Stub in an interface
                called DynamicStub so that these standard methods are still available in the
                dynamic case. However, this change is visible to client code, since clients may
                occasionally obtain a stub and directly handle it as a javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub
                class. This also necessarily occurs in the ORB itself. To allow such code to
                easily work in the new model, I introduced a new SPI called StubAdapter. This
                class has the following static methods:</P>
         <UL>
                <LI>boolean isStubClass( Class )</LI>
                <LI>boolean isStub( Object )</LI>
                <LI>void setDelegate( Object, Delegate )</LI>
                <LI>Delegate getDelegate( Object )</LI>
                <LI>org.omg.CORBA.Object activateServant( Servant )</LI>
                <LI>org.omg.CORBA.Object activateTie( Tie )</LI>
                <LI>ORB getORB( Object )</LI>
                <LI>String[] getTypeIds( Object )</LI>
                <LI>void connect( Object, ORB )</LI>
                <LI>boolean isLocal( Object )</LI>
                <LI>OutputStream request( Object, String, boolean )</LI>
         </UL>
         <P>These methods are implemented by checking two cases: either the Object
                is a java.rmi.CORBA.Stub, in which the object is cast to Stub, or else the
                Object is a DynamicStub, in which case the Object is cast to Stub. This is
                rather ugly, and completely non-object oriented, but is directly caused by the
                use of a class (instead of an interface) as the standard interface for all
                stubs in the RMI-IIOP specification.</P>
         <P>A dynamic proxy stub consists of two parts: a dynamic proxy which
                implements the remote interface as well as DynamicStub, and an
                InvocationHandler. The proxy is created using the standard JDK proxy mechanism.
                The invocation handler is a composite InvocationHandler that has two parts: one
                part delegates methods to DynamicStubImpl, and the other handles invocations on
                the methods of the remote interface as previously described.</P>
         <H5>BCEL stubs</H5>
         <P>The BCEL stubs are actually simpler than the Dynamic Proxy version,
                except for the actual class generation code. I have taken the approach of
                constructing a very light-weight proxy mechanism that is actually mostly
                independent of the RMI-IIOP stub requirements. Here the point is that a stub
                really is nothing more in essence than a proxy, and all of the other machinery
                that is part of the RMI-IIOP invocation process can be placed in a shared
                class.</P>
         <P>The interface to the proxy generator is as follows:</P>
         <PRE>
public class ProxyCreator extends CodeGeneratorBase implements Constants {
    public ProxyCreator( String className, String superClassName, Class[] interfaces,
        Method[] methods ) ;
}

public abstract class CodeGeneratorBase  {
    public Class create( ProtectionDomain pd, ClassLoader loader ) ;
}</PRE>
         <P>There are several requirements for using this class:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>superClass must have an accessible no-args constructor</LI>
                <LI>superclass must have an accessible method with the signature
                  <PRE>Object invoke( int methodNumber, Object[] args ) ;</PRE></LI>
                <LI>The methods passed into the ProxyCreator constructor must also be
                  made available throw some mechanism at runtime so that invoke method in the
                  superClass sees the same methods as were used to construct the proxy.</LI>
         </OL>
         <P>In my BCEL dynamic stub implementation, the superClass is called
                BCELStubBase. This class has the following interface:</P>
         <PRE>
public abstract class BCELStubBase extend javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub {
    public String[] _ids() ;

    public void initialize( String[] typeIds, InvocationHandler handler, 
        Methods[] methods ) ;

    protected Object invoke( int methodNumber, Object[] args ) throws Throwable 
    {
        Method method = methods[methodNumber] ;
        return handler.invoke( null, method, args ) ;
    }
}</PRE>
         <P>The _ids() method is required because it is an abstract method in
                javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub. It is implemented simply by returning the value of the
                typeIds argument that was passed into the initialize method. The initialize
                method itself simply stores its arguments in private fields in BCELStubBase.
                The implementation of the invoke method is quite simple: it simply obtains the
                appropriate java.lang.reflect.Method from the methods passed into the
                initialzie method, and then passes this method and the args to the handler that
                was passed into the initialize method.</P>
         <P>The generated code is also quite simple: for the method at index n of
                methods, the generated code simply:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>Creates an Object[] args sized to hold the arguments.</LI>
                <LI>Wraps args of primitive type in the appropriate wrapper (e.g.,
                  java.lang.Integer for an int)</LI>
                <LI>Copies the argument or argument wrapper into the args array.</LI>
                <LI>Calls invoke( n, args ) in the superClass.</LI>
                <LI>Unwraps the result if it is a primitive and then return the
                  result.</LI>
         </OL>
         <P>The invocation handler used here is the StubInvocationHandlerImpl
                previously described. This is why the BCEL case is actually simple: there is no
                need for a complex (and slower) InvocationHandler. Instead, we let the super
                classes directly handle all of the non-remote interface methods that are
                required for a Stub.</P>
         <H4>Stub Serialization</H4>
         <P>All RMI-IIOP stubs must be serializable. The serialized form is
                specified by the RMI-IIOP standard, and is simply the IOR written out to a Java
                OutputStream in the same way that an IOR is written to a CDR stream. In the
                static stub case, we simply rely on the javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub class, which
                implements readObject and writeObject methods that operate by delegating to the
                StubDelegate. The StubDelegateImpl class then simply reads and writes the IOR
                representation used for the Stub.</P>
         <P>The dynamic case is more complex, due to the fact that we cannot rely on
                the ClassLoader to directly load the correct Stub class. The static case works
                here by assuming that the ClassLoader can always get the Stub. In fact, this
                even handles downloadable stubs, since the ORB uses the RMIClassLoader to load
                stub classes. The two dynamic cases are each somewhat different.</P>
         <P>In the dynamic proxy case, DynamicStubImpl implements readObject,
                writeObject, and readResolve. The readObject and writeObject methods are the
                same as in the StubDelegateImpl code used in the static case. However, dynamic
                stubs have additional state as compared to static stubs, due to the need for
                information such as the DynamicMethodMarshalled and IDLNameTranslator.
                Consequently the DynamicStubImpl code also has a readResolve method. This
                method operates as follows:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>Get the repository ID from the IOR</LI>
                <LI>Get the interface class name from the repository ID</LI>
                <LI>Use the JDKBridge to load the interface class (which must be in the
                  local VM)</LI>
                <LI>Use the PresentationManager to get the class data, which contains the
                  IDLNameTranslator among other things</LI>
                <LI>Use the class data to create an InvocationHandlerFactoryImpl</LI>
                <LI>Use the InvocationHandlerFactoryImpl to create the InvocationHandler
                  that is returned.</LI>
         </OL>
         <P>When a dynamic proxy stub is serialized, the dynamic proxy itself is
                serialized. Dynamic proxies are serialized as a proxy descriptor plus the state
                of the proxy, which is just the InvocationHandler. Here the InvocationHandler
                is actually a private class called CustomCompositeInvocationHandlerImpl which
                is a nested class in the InvocationHandlerFactoryImpl class.
                CustomCompositeInvocationHandlerImpl defines a writeReplace method that simply
                returns the DynamicStubImpl, which we have already discussed.</P>
         <P>Now, when the dynamic proxy stub is deserialized, first a
                DynamicStubImpl is constructed, then its readObject method is called, which
                restores the IOR. Next the readResolve method is called, which creates the
                correct CustomCompositeInvocationHandlerImpl. Finally a proxy class is
                constructed which has the CustomCompositeInvocationHandlerImpl as its
                InvocationHandler.</P>
         <P>The BCEL case is somewhat different, and only partly implemented today
                (this is related to a bug that needs to be fixed in the app server). All of the
                state for the stub is contained in the BCELStubBase class. Since this class
                inherits from javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub, Stub serializes and deserializes the IOR.
                BCELStubBase has only transient fields, and the generated stub has no data, so
                the only state actually serialized in this case is the IOR. Hoever, as in the
                dynamic proxy case, the transient state of BCELStubBase must be restored on
                deserialization, and so BCELStubBase defines a readObject method for this
                purpose. This readObject method is actually rather similar to the
                DynamicStubImpl.readResolve method. However, this readObject just constructs a
                StubInvocationHandlerImpl instead of using the
                InvocationHandlerFactoryImpl.</P>
         <P>The BCEL case also needs to make sure that the BCEL generated class is
                available. This can be handled by adding a writeReplace method in the generated
                BCEL stub that calls a superClass method that writes a BCELStubBase instead of
                the generated BCEL stub class. Correspondingly a readResolve method is needed
                in the BCELStubBase that will generate the BCEL stub class, create an instance
                of this class, call the initialize method on the new instance, and return the
                result.</P> 
         <H3>Configuring the PresentationManager</H3>
         <P>Most configuration for the ORB is handled in the ORBImpl class when the
                ORB is created. However, the PresentationManager cannot be handled this way,
                because it is needed in the RMI-IIOP implementation. Much of the RMI-IIOP code
                runs when no ORB is available, and so the basic StubFactory mechanisms must be
                available even when there is no ORB. Consequently, the PresentationManager is
                configured statically in the ORB SPI class. That is, the PresentationManager is
                a singleton, and is shared by all ORBs (at least within the same ClassLoader as
                usual). </P>
         <P>There are two system properties that are used to configure the
                PresentationManager in a static initializer in the ORB SPI class:</P>
         <UL>
                <LI>com.sun.CORBA.ORBUseDynamicStub, which is a boolean. This flag
                  indicates to use dynamic (true) or static (false) stubs for all RMI-IIOP stubs.
                  IDL stubs are static in either case.</LI>
                <LI>com.sun.CORBA.ORBDynamicStubFactoryFactoryClass, which is a String
                  representing a Class name. This value (if set) indicates that a special
                  StubFactoryFactory is to be used. If this property is not set to a valid
                  StubFactoryFactory class, the dynamic proxy version is used. This allows us to
                  place the entire BCEL-based StubFactoryFactory into the optional part of the
                  ORB.</LI>
         </UL></BODY>
