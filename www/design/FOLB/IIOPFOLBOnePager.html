                  <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong></p>

                         <li> 
                                <p><strong>Project Description</strong></p> 
                                <p>The purpose of this project is to bring IIOP FOLB features from
                                  GlassFish v2.1.1 to GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1. In 
addition,
                                  there are some bugs that exist in the GF 2.1.1 release in IIOP 
FOLB that we
                                  would like to address in GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1.
 Fixing these
                                  bugs requires making some architectural changes in the way the 
handling of the
                                  CSIv2 (secure IIOP) protocol is divided between the ORB and the
                                  security/ejb.security module in the app server code.</p> 
                                <p>Note that most of this work was previously reviewed in WSARC
                                  case
                                  <a 
href="http://sac.sfbay.sun.com/arc/WSARC/2007/141/RMI-IIOP-LoadBalancing.html">2007/141</a>.
                                  The references in 2007/141 are still relevant to this current 
work, but
                                  unfortunately the links are currently broken to 
www.glassfishwiki.org/gfwiki.
                                  See the references <a href="#ReferenceDocuments">section</a> for 
more current
                                  links. </p> 
                                <p>There are some secondary goals for IIOP FOLB, which may not be
                                  addressed in GF 3.1, given the short time schedule.</p> 
                                <p> It would be nice to think about better integration of the
                                  per-request load balancing feature (PRLB) which was done in a GF 
2.1.1 patch
                                  for Argela. In particular, the normal InitialContext load 
balancing is not
                                  compatible with PRLB, so configuring both behaviors should be 
viewed as an
                                  error. Currently configurating PRLB requires adding a special 
configuration
                                  flag to the EJB descriptor, and there is no admin support for this
 feature.</p>
                                
                                <p>Similarly, better integration and administration of IIOP
                                  hardware loadbalancer (HWLB) support would be useful. The HWLB 
support was
                                  added in GF 2 for NTT West some time ago. Configuring IIOP HWLB 
currently
                                  requires setting some obscure ORB flags. HWLB is also incompatible
 at the ORB
                                  level with other forms of load balancing.</p> 
                                <p>Another big development item is getting some system-level
                                  testing of IIOP FOLB written for small clusters. Currently this 
happens only in
                                  SQE tests, which have too long a testing cycle to give sufficient 
feedback to
                                  development. This is also dependent on getting a framework put 
together for
                                  supporting cluster testing. </p> </li> 
                         <li> 
                                <p><strong>Risks and Assumptions</strong></p> 
                                <p>FOLB system testing is dependent on the availability of a
                                  suitable testing framework.</p> 
                                <p>The CSIv2 code is complex and delicate, and the CSIv2 CTS tests
                                  are difficult to work with.</p> 
                                <p>CORBA customer escalations may impact the FOLB
                                  schedule.</p></li>

                                <p>Support of high availability and scalability for large systems.
                                  This feature covers only the IIOP protocol.</p></li>

                                <p><strong>Justification</strong></p> 
                                <p>The primary justification for this work is feature parity with
                                  GF v2.1.1. We would also like to fix the CSIv2/FOLB bug described 
in Issue
                                  2791. However, fixing 2791 is not a release driver.</p></li>

                                <p><strong>Details</strong></p> 
                                <p>The technical details are described primarily in the functional
                                  <a href="#FuncSpec">specification</a>. Here I will only describe 
the changes
                                  from the original AS 9.0 EE implementation.</p> 
                                <p>Access to the required GMS interfaces will be done using GF 3.1
                                  facilities instead of using Class.forName(). </p> 
                                <p>A number of changes in support of CSIv2 with FOLB may be made.
                                Ideally, I'd like to at least get the handling of CSIv2 tagged 
components moved
                                into the ORB, but this is considered to be P3 or less for V3.1.</p> 
                                <p>A number of changes will be needed for load balancing in the
                                  naming code, which has changed substantially in GlassFish version 
3, and those
                                  changes will be carried forward into GlassFish Server Open Source 
Edition
                                  3.1.</p> </li>

 of CSIv2. A

                                <p>Some changes will be needed in the orb-iiop and orb-connector
                                  modules to accommodate the integration of GMS into GlassFish 
Server Open Source

                                <p>Some SQE tests exist for IIOP FOLB. One of the PDE tasks for
                                  this feature is to obtain the SQE tests or construct new tests 
that can run in
                                  some kind of cluster testing framework. Given that PDE can do 
this, there
                                  should be little impact on SQE, other than the usual execution of 
existing
                                  tests across the support configuration matrix.</p> </li>
