<h1>Switching to java.nio</h1>
<ul><li><h2>Try this:</h2></li>
<li><ul><li>Make ByteBufferWithInfo closed, providing methods for get/setting bytes and index rather than direct array access.</li>
<li>When that works, try switching to <a href="http://java.nio.ByteBuffers/">java.nio.ByteBuffers</a>.  Will need to do some work to see if you want direct/indirect buffers, develop a cache since they're expensive to create, etc.</li>
<li>Experiment with replacing our marshaling code with that actually on the nio buffer.  Performance gain?</li>
<li>Revamp CodeSetConversion to stop taking byte[]'s.</li>
</ul></li></ul></body>
