<h1><a href="http://javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub/">javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub</a> Bug</h1>
<ul><li><h2>Hitachi has escalated the <a href="http://javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub/">javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub</a> cross JDK incompatibility bug.  CTE is in the process of fixing it in J2SE 1.4.0_xx.  I haven't heard if they're going to let it into Hopper, but I doubt it, so CTE will handle it in a Hopper update release.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Someone needs to put this change into rip-int, too.  (Adding the serialVersionUID to the class, see the bug report)</h2></li>
