<h1>Why class4 and class5 incompat?</h1>
<ul><li><h2>When class5's TestObjectSuper tries to read its extra optional data, it is at a point in the stream in which blockLength is already maxBlockLength and it's right at the beginning of an end tag.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Since blockLength is maxBlockLength (what start_block uses to prevent recursive calls from alignAndCheck and checkBlockLength as well as when the next thing is a valuetag or end tag), our code never checks for an end tag in checkBlockLength  We ultimately get a MARSHAL exception.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Tried many ways around this, but ultimately it was too complicated and didn't work in all cases.  These tests will generally show you pretty quickly if your changes help.</h2></li>
</ul></body>
