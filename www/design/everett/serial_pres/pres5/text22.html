<h1>Stream Format Version 2 Issues</h1>
<ul><li><h2>This works great for normal data in the stream, but what about encapsulations?  Especially Codecs in PI and our service contexts!  Currently, my implementation uses stream format version 1 for this kind of thing, but this won't work well if Throwable evolves further (UnknownExceptionInfo service context) or people marshal RMI-IIOP valuetypes with Codecs.  (BEA is doing more these days with valuetypes in service contexts.)</h2></li>
<li><h2>Anys don't seem to be an issue since they keep valuetypes until the Any is written to a stream, and then just hand the valuetype to the Any.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Testing is going to be difficult.  The best tests here involve class evolution, both superclasses and most derived classes evolving to add writeObject methods with and without optional data.</h2></li>
</ul></body>
