<p> Now that we have Dynamic RMI-IIOP (DRI) functioning very well, it is
                time to consider optimizations. I use the simpleperf test to measure
the cost                of optimized co-located calls, which is the only case where
the impact of DRI               is significant. We can measure this with static
stubs, with dynamic stubs and           no optimized copyobject, and dynamic
stubs and optimized copyobject. The             results are very informative. </p>

<p>Generally 1.5.0 is fully 3 times faster than 1.4.2_04. &nbsp;The
ratio is usually preserved, but note that the full servant caching BCEL
number is not improved as much as in the static stub case.<br>
</p>
<p>All times are given in microseconds. When two times are given, the
first           is a straight creation, and the second is a creation followed
by a            object-&gt;string-&gt;object conversion, which seems to cause
the test to run                 faster (I have no idea why). In all cases, the
invocation tests were run 10000                 times, and these numbers reflect the
average time per invocation. The test           implementation does nothing: it
just receives a single long argument and                returns what it received. </p>
        
<p> A number of things can be learned from these numbers (which have
been            pretty consistent every time I have run them). First, the
"resolve" sometimes             makes a large difference, particularly in the
full caching case. This is a            puzzle. Another surprise is that the
dynamic stubs/optimized copy/minimal            caching case is so slow. There
does appear to be much more variability in the          dynamic stub numbers,
which may indicate more GC activity, but I have not as          yet explored
this. </p>

<p>The largest component of the time is now obvious from the 1.5 numbers:
calling copyObjects costs a lot of time, even with the highly optimized
copyObject implementation.  In fact, without the copyObject overhead, the
dynamic case takes barely twice as much time as the static.  
<p>Taking just the full caching and info only caching, we see that the
                difference between dynamic and static ranges from about 6-19
microseconds per                call. This is the cost of using reflection and
packaging all of the arguments          in native wrappers and arrays, and
also the cost of copyObject(s) calls.           copyObject is particularly
important, since the overhead of not using the          optimized copyObject
code is about 250-300 microseconds per call. This seems to              be the
cost of creating 2 ORB streams (one for argument copying and one for
                copying the result). The tests in the same machine/different ORB case
show no                 consistent differences, leading me to believe that the stream
creation overhead               is similar in both cases, as in both cases we
create an argument and a result                 stream, and the processing is nearly
the same. This looks like 20% of the cost               of a remote invocation
(with a very fast network) is due to stream creation. We                could also
run the local/different ORB tests with Java serialization and see
                what the difference is, but I have not done this so far. </p>
        
<p> There are significant opportunities for optimization in the current
                implementation. I will focus on the BCEL proxy implementation, since
that is                 the one we will ship. It also appears likely that there is
significantly more              opportunity there for optimization than in the
proxy-based implementation. We          will still preserve the JDK proxy
implementation for the present. It is           becoming apparent that my
original idea of using the same InvocationHandler for           both JDK and
BCEL proxies may not work, and it definitely not optimal. </p>
        
<p> One big optimization is possible in the InvocationHandlerFactory.
This            currently constructs an InvocationHandler that dispatches
requests to the                 remote interfaes, as well as DynamicStub,
org.omg.CORBA.Object, and               java.lang.Object. This is necessary because
JDK proxies all extend          java.lang.reflect.Proxy, so the base class
cannot do anything useful for the               application. However, the BCEL
proxies extend BCELStubBase which extends               javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub, and
Stub implements everything needed except for the                remote interfaces
themselves. This means that we never need to do an              InvocationHandler
lookup in the BCEL proxy case. In fact, the BCEL proxy just             goes
directly to the StubInvocationHandler, rather than the more complex
                composite invocation handler returned by the
InvocationHandlerFactoryImpl            class. </p>
        
<p> Another area to look at is the doPrivileged block that calls
                setAccessible in the StubInvocationHandlerImpl code. This is happening
on every                call. However, there is a simple solution: just check
isAccessible() before           doing the setAccessible call. isAccessible
simply returns a boolean in the JDK,            so its cost is trivial. This
avoids doing the doPrivilege block on every call.               </p>
        
<p> I also need to look at the implementation of copyObject(s).
Optimizing              this further will be difficult, as the code is already
fairly close to optimal                 for what it does (without pushing further
into dynamic code generation for                class copiers). We can determine
when a copyObjects call is made with nothing            but wrapped primitives
and avoid the array copy in that case. We cannot skip           copying wrapped
primitives, but the code handles those as immutables anyway.            </p>
        
<p> A more difficult optimization would be to change the BCEL generated
                proxy code so that a different dispatch path was used for local calls,
one that                avoided wrapping and allocating an argument array
completely. I'll probably               explore this again, but this will not be
possible before the Milestone 4                 deadline. </p>
