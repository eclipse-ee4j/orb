<H2>CORBA (RMI-IIOP) Schedule</H2>
<P>The CORBA schedule is maintained in a pure Java application called
JxProject. JxProject can produce output in a binary form and also in
XML. Harold has written an XSLT script that produces an HTML page
from the JxProject XML file. Ken has written an XQuery program that
was used to re-organize the future items on the schedule according to
release, category, and priority.  This version is now the main
schedule. 
</P>
<P>To update the schedule: 
</P>
<OL>
        <LI>Use JxProject to update the
        schedule in docs/schedule/schedule.jxp in a CORBA workspace</P>
        <LI>Export the schedule to XML as
        schedule.xml 
        <LI>Put schedule.jxp and schedule.xml
        back to rip-int-generic 
        <LI>Run &quot;sh tohtml&quot; in the
        docs/schedule directory in rip-int-generic to generate the HTML
        version 
</OL>
<P>The master copy of the schedule is kept in the rip-int-generic
workspace, which is located at
/net/anybodys/export3/ws/rip-int-generic. The schedule is always in
the docs/schedule directory in a CORBA workspace.  
</P>
<P>The html version of the schedule can be viewed <A HREF="http://javaweb.sfbay.sun.com/~kcavan/rip-int-generic/docs/schedule/schedule.html">here</A>
in HTML form. This includes all schedule items for AS 8.2 and 9, and
the Mustang release of J2SE, organized by release, category, and
priority. 
</P>
<P>The categories are: 
</P>
<UL>
        <LI>SQ: service quality. This includes
        new product features that require ORB support. 
        <LI>Sec: security. 
        <LI>MM: Management and Monitoring. 
        <LI>Maint: maintainability. This
        includes features that improve the quality of the ORB in areas such
        as test, build, internal code structure, and other non-product
        visible items. 
        <LI>Perf: performance. 
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are 4 priorities with meaning
roughly as follows: 
</P>
<UL>
        <LI>P1: This is required for the
        release (release driver in J2SE). 
        <LI>P2: This is important for the
        ORB, but may not make the release if insufficient resources are
        available (group driver in J2SE). 
        <LI>P3: This is nice to have, but may
        not make the release (target of opportunity in J2SE). 
        <LI>P4: An important feature at least for some customers, but we
        do not believe that sufficient resources will be available. We will
        not even schedule such items. 
</UL>
