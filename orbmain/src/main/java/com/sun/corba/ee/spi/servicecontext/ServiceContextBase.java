/**
 * Base class for all ServiceContext classes. There is a derived ServiceContext class for each service context that the
 * ORB supports. Each subclass encapsulates the representation of the service context and provides any needed methods
 * for manipulating the service context. Each subclass must provide the following members:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * </li>a public static final int SERVICE_CONTEXT_ID that gives the OMG (or other) defined id for the service context.
 * This is needed for the registration mechanism defined in ServiceContexts. OMG defined service context ids are taken
 * from section 13.6.7 of ptc/98-12-04.</li>
 * <li>a public constructor that takes an InputStream as its argument.</li>
 * <li>Appropriate definitions of getId() and writeData(). getId() must return SERVICE_CONTEXT_ID.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The subclass can be constructed either directly from the service context representation, or by reading the
 * representation from an input stream. These cases are needed when the service context is created and written to the
 * request or reply, and when the service context is read from the received request or reply.
