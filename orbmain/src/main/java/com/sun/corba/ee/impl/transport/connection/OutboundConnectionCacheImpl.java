/**
 * Manage connections that are initiated from this VM. Connections are managed by a get/release mechanism and cached by
 * the ContactInfo used to create them. For efficiency, multiple connections (referred to as parallel connections) may
 * be created using the same ContactInfo. Connections are reclaimed when they are no longer in use and there are too
 * many connections open.
 * <P>
 * A connection is obtained through the get method, and released back to the cache through the release method. Note that
 * a connection that is released may still be expecting a response, in which case the connection is NOT eligible for
 * reclamation. If a connection is released to the cache while expecting a response, the connection must me made
 * available for reclamation by calling responseReceived.
 *
 * XXX Should a get/release cycle expect at most one response? Should it support more than one response? Are there cases
 * where we don't know in advance how many responses are expected?
 * <P>
 * A connection basically represents some sort of communication channel, but few requirements are placed on the
 * connection. Basically the ability to close a connection is required in order for reclamation to work.
 * <P>
 * Also we need the ContactInfo as a factory for the Connection.
