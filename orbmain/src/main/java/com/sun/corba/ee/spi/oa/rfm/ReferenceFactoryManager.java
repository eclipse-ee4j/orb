/**
 * ReferenceFactoryManager uses the ORB POA to create a specialized reference factory. This is done primarily so that
 * all POAs managed here can be restarted in order to be updated when parts of the ORB configuration are changed. For
 * example, this is used in AS 9 to support dynamic fail over, which requires re-configuring the App server POAs
 * whenever an instance joins or leaves a cluster.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this interface can be obtained from an ORB by calling resolve_initial_references(
 * "ReferenceFactoryManager" ). The ORB will have an instance of this available if it is started with the property
 * ORBConstants.USER_CONFIGURATOR_PREFIX + "com.sun.corba.ee.impl.oa.rfm.ReferenceManagerConfigurator" set to a value
 * (usually we use "1" as the value, but that does not matter). This will cause the configurator to set up the ORB so
 * that the ReferenceFactoryManager is available, so long as the configurator class is available. Since this code is in
 * the optional package, this just means that the optional ORB package contents must be in the classpath.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is a simulated IDL local interface, but there is no actual IDL for this interface.
 * <P>
 * Note that the suspend and resume methods must be called from the same thread in order for the thread synchronization
 * to be handled correctly. Calling either of the restart() methods guarantees this, but disallows more complex ORB
 * configuration changes.
