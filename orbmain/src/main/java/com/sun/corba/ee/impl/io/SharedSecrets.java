/**
 * A repository of "shared secrets", which are a mechanism for calling implementation-private methods in another package
 * without using reflection. A package-private class implements a public interface and provides the ability to call
 * package-private methods within that package; the object implementing that interface is provided through a third
 * package to which access is restricted. This framework avoids the primary disadvantage of using reflection for this
 * purpose, namely the loss of compile-time checking.
