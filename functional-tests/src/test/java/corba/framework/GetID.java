/**
 * Generates unique test-ids 
 *
 * The GetID class generates a test-ID for identifying tests in the 
 * log files. The ID is generated by replacing the '.'s in the
 * full-qualified package name by '_'s, and then appending a user-specified
 * string Id. Since, the fully qualified package name is unique across a 
 * test-suite, this results in unique IDs.
