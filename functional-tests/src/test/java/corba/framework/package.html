         <OL> 
                <LI> When I use the term "process" in this document, it doesn't
                  necessarily mean java.lang.Process.&nbsp; Most of the time, ORBD, clients,
                  servers, and compilers are executed in separate java.lang.Process's.&nbsp;
                  However, if the test author uses a different execution strategy (<I>see
                  <A HREF="#Writing a more sophisticated test">Writing a more sophisticated
                  test</A></I>), something may run in the same java.lang.Process as the test
                  framework.</LI> 
                <LI> The IBM test framework depends on a command line option -output to
                  specify the output directory, and the framework depends on it, as well.&nbsp;
                  This directory must be on the classpath, and our makefiles already work this
                  way.&nbsp; The output directory is <TT>gen</TT> on Solaris, and since the
                  framework is always run from <TT>test/build/solaris</TT>, that's where it
                  is.&nbsp; (On Win32, it's right off of the workspace directory.) &nbsp; Each
                  test has its own special output directory under this one, and its name is
                  <TT>&lt;command line output directory&gt;/&lt;test package name&gt;</TT>.</LI> 
                <LI> The framework and its tests live in subdirectories of
                  <TT>test/src/share/classes/corba</TT>.&nbsp; The package names are
                  <TT>corba.*</TT>.</LI> 
                <LI> Each test has a main Java file that is it's heart, and it extends
                  <TT><A
                  HREF="CORBATest.html">CORBATest</A></TT>.&nbsp;
                  This is where the test author directs the flow of the test through compilation,
                  creation and execution of processes, and finally, how they are destroyed.</LI> 
                <LI> The framework makes assumptions about directory paths.&nbsp; It
                  assumes it starts in the <TT>test/build/$OS</TT> directory and can find things
                  off of that.&nbsp; However, I think all these assumptions are isolated in the
                  initialization of the <TT><A

                from Options. Then, when running the makefiles, simply provided a

         <H2> <A NAME="Examining a test's output"></A>Examining a test's output</H2>
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE>The framework captures stdout and stderr streams for the
                compilers, ORBD, servers, and clients.&nbsp; The convention is <TT>&lt;process
                name&gt;.out.txt</TT> and <TT>&lt;process name&gt;.err.txt</TT>.&nbsp; The test
                author can decide on process names for server and client, or use the defaults
                ("server" and "client").&nbsp; The only time it's absolutely necessary to
                assign new names is when there are multiple servers or clients. 
                <P>These files are located in the test's output directory.&nbsp; This is
                  the directory specified on the command line (with the <TT>-output</TT> switch)
                  plus the test's package name.&nbsp; Our makefiles currently specify

         <H2> <A NAME="How to debug a test"></A>How to debug a test</H2> 
         <BLOCKQUOTE>The first thing to do if a test fails is to
                <A HREF="#Examining a test's output">examine the test's output</A>.&nbsp; If
                the failure seems unusual, try running the test again.&nbsp; If it looks like a
                real problem, you can ask the framework to tell you exactly how it's starting
                each process.&nbsp; You do this by specifying the <TT>-debug</TT> command line
                parameter on the failing test's line in <TT>CORBATests.txt</TT>.&nbsp; 
                <P> When you still can't tell what's wrong, or if you want to dive into a
                  process with JDB, here's how to do it: </P> 
                <P> <B><U>Case 1: You want to debug something run in a separate
                  java.lang.Process</U></B> </P> 
                <P> This is quite easy if you want to use JDB or a similar
                  debugger.&nbsp; The framework will take care of setting the execution strategy
                  to <A
                  HREF="DebugExec.html">DebugExec</A>.&nbsp;
                  This strategy will provide you with the command to run JDB both on the screen
                  and in a file in your <TT>test/build/$OS</TT> directory. </P> 
                <P> Edit the <TT>test/src/share/classes/corba/CORBATests.txt</TT>
                  file.&nbsp; On the line with the test you want to debug, put the
                  <TT>-debug</TT> flag followed by a colon separated list of the process names
                  you want to debug.&nbsp; If the test uses the default names, you can run
                  <B>ORBD</B>, <B>client</B>, and <B>server</B> processes outside of the
                  framework in your debugger.&nbsp; (Note: it is case sensitive) </P> 
                <P> <B>Example:</B> </P> 
                <P> <TT>-test corba.example.Example -debug client:server</TT> </P> 
                <P> When it comes time for the server or client process to start, the
                  framework will prompt you to do so in another window.&nbsp; It will give you an
                  adapted command which uses JDB as the debugger.&nbsp; In addition, it will
                  write that command to the <TT>test/build/$OS</TT> directory as a file called
                  <TT>jdb&lt;process name&gt;.bat</TT>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, on Solaris, you must
                  still set the execution permission before you can run it.&nbsp; The debug
                  strategy will also prompt you for other information during the test. </P> 
                <P> <U>Note: the .bat files are erased after the test finishes</U> </P> 
                <P>There are two other debug options: -rdebug, which uses JPDA, and
                  -odebug, which uses Bil Lewis's Omniscient Debugger (odb). A version of odb is
                  in the workspace under the Lib directory. Both options take the same arguments
                  as the -debug flag. The difference is in how the controller is attached to a
                  debugger. -rdebug launches the VM for the controller with the JPDA arguments
                  necessary for attaching your favorite JPDA-enabled debugger (e.g. NetBeans,
                  jswat, jdebugtool) to the controller. -odebug launches the main java class in
                  the controller under odb, which then captures all events during the execution
                  of the VM, and makes the entire execution history available in a viewer after
                  the program terminates (or it is told to terminate through a button on a window
                  that odb launches)</P> 
                <P> <B><U>Case 2: You want to edit a sophisticated test that uses unusual
                  execution strategies</U></B> </P> 
                <P> This is harder, but not impossible.&nbsp; You must run the entire
                  test framework under your debugger.&nbsp; This can be done quite easily under
                  Solaris simply by setting the environment variable DEBUGGER to 1 and running a
                  test suite from the Makefile. This launches the test framework using JPDA, and
                  any JPDA debugger can connect to the test framework. Since you probably only
                  want to debug one test at a time, watch how the makefile and framework load
                  tests from the file.&nbsp; Copy and adapt how the makefile starts the framework
                  so it works with your debugger.&nbsp; You should be able to give the line out
                  of CORBATests.txt for your test directly as a parameter to the framework,
                  rather than letting the makefile give it the <TT>-file</TT> parameter.

         <BLOCKQUOTE>Assuming you follow some guidelines when writing your test, it
                should be simple to insert it in the framework.&nbsp; It may be easier for you
                to write it outside of the framework until it's running.&nbsp; The framework
                does the IDL compilation for you, but that also means that any code that
                depends on the stubs or skeletons must be compiled as a part of the test
                (usually your client and server test code).&nbsp; When you run the target, the
                output directory is wiped, and the framework starts at the beginning --
                compiling IDL, compiling generated code, etc.&nbsp; That takes time, and may
                make it frustrating if you still have simple programming errors in your code.

                  System.getProperties() since a considerable amount of information is passed

         <OL> 
                <LI> All clients and servers should implement <I>something like</I>
                  <TT>corba.framework.InternalProcess</TT> to make it easier to switch execution
                  strategies.&nbsp; They could have a static main which passes in system
                  properties and streams, then catches the exception, prints it, and exits with
                  an error code if something went wrong.</LI> 
                <LI> Work on all execution strategies to make them clean.&nbsp; Dealing
                  with asynchronous processes is hard, but there must be a nice way to clean up
                  all those cases.</LI> 
                <LI> Probably, newORBDController and the others should be removed in
                  favor of setting this in <TT><A
                  HREF="Options.html">Options</A></TT></LI>
                
                <LI> <TT><A
                  HREF="ThreadExec.html">ThreadExec</A></TT>
                  and <TT><A
                  HREF="InternalExec.html">InternalExec</A></TT>
                  need to be unified such that a client/server can be switched easily, the two
                  have the same semantics where possible, and there are no further requirements
                  other than InternalProcess (this means that <TT>ThreadProcess</TT> should go
                  away or just become an adapter)</LI> 
                <LI> Simplify makefiles or create a script/small program</LI> 
                <LI> Fix deprecation warnings (some tests used
                  DataInputStream/DataOutputStream)</LI> 
                <LI> Rewrite the <TT><A
                  HREF="Controller.html">Controller</A></TT>
                  and everything else to throw specific exceptions -- TimeoutException,
                  BadExitValueException, InvalidStateException, etc.&nbsp; Much more tedious, but
                  more descriptive and precise.</LI> 
                <LI> A next generation project might use CORBA to talk and exchange
                  special references between processes.&nbsp; Similar to the way the old test
                  framework used RMI to do this for servants, except much more broad.&nbsp; You
                  could have the processes running ANYWHERE -- including in the same process as
                  the test, and not have all the special cases associated with them.&nbsp;
                  However, that's a bit heavy weight, and it's hard to justify using what we're
                  testing to build a test framework to test it!</LI> 
         </OL> 
         <H3> <U>Bugs</U></H3> 
         <OL> 
                <LI> When using internal execution strategies with RMI, the system will
                  not be able to find the new class files since they will be under
                  <TT>gen/&lt;package&gt;/&lt;package&gt;</TT> but the runtime only has
                  <TT>gen</TT> on the classpath.&nbsp; The work around is to set the output
                  directory in <TT><A
                  HREF="Options.html">Options</A></TT>
                  (in that particular test) to just be <TT>gen</TT> and deal with the
                  ramifications of that.&nbsp; This doesn't seem to happen in the CORBA case --
                  it seems to use the framework's special class loader appropriately.</LI> 
                <LI> On Windows, the first time you start an ORBD process, it seems like
                  ORBD creates a subprocess for a few seconds. This normally isn't a problem, but
                  will be if you want to shut down ORBD and restart it (as in the PCOSNaming
                  test). If you don't give ORBD a little more time to start (the first time) with
                  a Thread.sleep, this mystery process will hang around. When you kill and
                  restart ORBD, it will prevent the restart, causing the test to time out waiting
                  for the ORBD handshake.</LI> 
                <LI> On Windows with Kestrel, the framework may hang at the end of
                  CORBAUtil.startProcess when it tries to pipe the error stream to a file. This
                  may be a java.io bug.</LI> 
                <LI> If your IDL doesn't have a module name, your test will fail. The
                  generated code will be placed in gen/&lt;test package&gt;, and javac will
                  complain of a multiple declaration. </LI> 
                <LI> The IDL compiler doesn't set a non-zero exit value on failure.&nbsp;
                  Thus, make sure to check <TT>idlcompiler.err.txt</TT> if your test fails with
                  an unusual javac error.</LI>
